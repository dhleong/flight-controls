FlightControls
==============

Control various FSX instruments from your Android device

## Why?

I recently got into flying planes in 
[Flight Simulator X](http://store.steampowered.com/app/314160/)
and wanted a better way to interact with some of the switches and
instruments that I couldn't map onto my flight stick and throttle.

Also, I wanted to try out [Dagger 2](http://google.github.io/dagger/)

## Dependencies

- [jSimConnect 0.8](http://lc0277.gratisim.fr/jsimconnect.html) (LGPL)
